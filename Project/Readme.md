<h1>Forecastability in Chaotic Neural Dynamics Using Reservoir Computing</h1>

<p>This project explores the forecastability of chaotic neural dynamics using the Echo State Network (ESN) framework. The main focus is on simulating and predicting the behavior of the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model, which mimics biological neurons' spiking and bursting behavior.</p>

<h2>Problem A: HR Neuron Model</h2>
<p>The Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neuron model captures different neuronal activities such as spiking, bursting, and chaos. This section involves generating bifurcation diagrams and analyzing time series data to simulate these dynamic behaviors.</p>

<h2>Problem B: Echo State Network (ESN) Implementation</h2>
<p>The ESN is implemented to predict the behavior of the HR neuron model. By optimizing hyperparameters like reservoir size, spectral radius, and leaky coefficient, the ESN can effectively forecast the chaotic and periodic dynamics of the neuron model.</p>
