<h1>Theory of Neural Dynamics - FAU Erlangen</h1>

<p>The <strong>Theory of Neural Dynamics</strong> course at <a href="https://www.fau.eu">FAU Erlangen, Germany</a> explores the mathematical modeling of neural activity and its applications to machine learning and computational neuroscience. Students study various neuronal models, such as the Hindmarsh-Rose model, which captures complex neural behaviors like spiking, bursting, and chaos.</p>

<p>Through the course, students gain hands-on experience with numerical simulations of neuron models and learn techniques such as <strong>reservoir computing</strong> and <strong>Echo State Networks (ESN)</strong> to forecast chaotic neural dynamics. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementations using programming tools like Python.</p>

<p>This course is ideal for those interested in understanding how neurons process information, neural coding, and the intersection of neuroscience with artificial intelligence.</p>
